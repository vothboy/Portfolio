They would tie fish and game to large Western red\r\n                cedar or alder planks. They would then place the planks around\r\n                open fires, and the residual heat from the fire would cook the\r\n                fish or game.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                This cooking procedure was done for hundreds of years, more out\r\n                of a necessity for a cooking surface than anything else.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                In the late 1990’s I started experimenting with cooking planks.\r\n                While developing the menu for Palisade Restaurant I was\r\n                introduced to baking planks. I was intrigued by this method of\r\n                cooking as it gave us a tie to the Northwest Native Americans\r\n                and was a simple yet flavorful and healthy way to cook.\r\n              </p>\r\n\r\n              <p>\r\n                Salmon was the first recipe I created for plank cooking. Chef\r\n                Garrett Cho and I worked on perfecting a great salmon recipe\r\n                which we eventually placed on the opening menu for Palisade-it\r\n                quickly became one of the bestselling entrées.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <div className=\"row\">\r\n                <p className=\"col-12 col-sm-6\">\r\n                  Soon after that I asked my step-father, Phil Bagwill if he’d\r\n                  make cedar planks for me to use. He did, and in so doing\r\n                  started a business for himself selling baking and BBQ planks\r\n                  to specialty and food stores. Phil came to me and asked me to\r\n                  create a cookbook for him. So my family and I ate from cedar\r\n                  and alder baking planks for months, until I had enough great\r\n                  recipes to make the Cedar Plank Cookbook-or the blue cookbook\r\n                  as we call it.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <img\r\n                  alt=\"historyplacholder\"\r\n                  src={History_image_placeholder}\r\n                  style={{ height: \"250px\" }}\r\n                  className=\"img-fluid center col-12 col-sm-6\"\r\n                />\r\n              </div>\r\n              <p>\r\n                I also started experimenting with BBQ Planks, and within another\r\n                year I had the Plankcooking Cookbook (or the green cookbook). It\r\n                includes recipes specifically designed for Alder Baking Planks,\r\n                Cedar BBQ Planks, as well as Cedar Baking Planks.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <h2 className=\"boarderBottom\">PLANK INFORMATION</h2>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Baking Planks – The benefits of using baking planks are many.\r\n                They impart subtle wood flavors, and they maintain the natural\r\n                juices in the meats and vegetables that are cooked on the plank,\r\n                making for moist flavorful foods. They are easy to use and\r\n                because they maintain the natural moisture you don’t need to add\r\n                other fats, such as butter; but of course you still can if you\r\n                want. Our baking planks come in two different woods-both Western\r\n                red cedar and alder. The cedar is a little more aromatic and\r\n                adds a stronger woodsy flavor to the foods that are cooked on\r\n                it. The alder is milder and sweeter, with a very subtle flavor.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                The baking planks are designed to be used in your home oven.\r\n                They are made to be used repeatedly for years to come. Using 1\r\n                ½” thick kiln-dried wood, the center of the plank is routed out\r\n                to form a cooking surface. Then we drill two holes through the\r\n                plank on each end, and place a metal bolt running through the\r\n                holes with a knot on each end. This is done to help keep the\r\n                plank from cracking; or if it does crack to help hold it\r\n                together so it can be used for years.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                BBQ Planks – Have similar benefits to that of the baking plank,\r\n                in addition the BBQ planks add incredible flavor to the foods\r\n                cooked on them-from the woodsy flavored cedar oils to the rich\r\n                smoke from the charred edges and bottom. They, too, maintain\r\n                natural moisture in the foods cooked on them. Our BBQ planks are\r\n                made from clear Western red cedar. BBQ planks are designed to be\r\n                used on your BBQ and are intended to be used one time.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <h2 className=\"boarderBottom\">\r\n                BAKING PLANK – USE, CARE, HANDLING & CLEANING\r\n              </h2>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Before using your plank for the first time it is best to oil the\r\n                entire plank with an inexpensive vegetable oil. Using a paper\r\n                towel, rub oil over the entire plank front, back, sides, and the\r\n                cooking surface. Remove any excess oil with a clean paper towel.\r\n                You only need to oil the plank once. The oil will help maintain\r\n                the beauty of the natural woods and keep it from staining. After\r\n                oiling it is ready for use.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                Baking planks never need to be soaked in water. They are to be\r\n                used in your home oven. The oven should always be pre-heated to\r\n                between 375° to 425º depending on the recipe. You will always\r\n                use the oven in baking mode, never on the broiler. The plank\r\n                should always be placed in the center of the oven on the metal\r\n                rack. If your plank has a slight crack, it can be placed on a\r\n                cookie sheet to ensure none of the juices flow onto the oven's\r\n                surface. It is best to use a conventional oven. A convection\r\n                oven can be used, but the whirling hot air can lead to a\r\n                splitting or cracking of the plank.\r\n              </p>\r\n              <p>\r\n                After use, baking planks should be washed with warm water and\r\n                dish soap. I like to use the orange and yellow Tuffy™ pad to\r\n                remove any baked on juices or seasoning. Rinse with hot water\r\n                and let the plank air dry. Place in a dry cupboard until next\r\n                use.\r\n              </p>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n        {/* ================================================================ */}\r\n        <section className=\"col-sm-12 col-md-8 display\">\r\n          <div className=\"pushToLeft row\">\r\n            <div\r\n              className=\"aboutBoardBackground\"\r\n              style={{ width: \"650px\", marginLeft: \"5px\" }}\r\n            >\r\n              <img\r\n                src={JH_Photo}\r\n                className=\"mainRightSidePicSize img-fluid\"\r\n                alt=\"JHPHOTO\"\r\n              />\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"paperBackground pl-5\">\r\n              <div className=\"size12Font pr-5\">\r\n                <h2 className=\"boarderBottom\">ABOUT JOHN HOWIE</h2>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Chef John Howie is widely recognized as the foremost expert on\r\n                  plank cooking, the time-honored Northwest Native American\r\n                  method of roasting fish, meats and fowl on cedar planks.

After oiling it is ready for use.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  Baking planks never need to be soaked in water. They are to be\r\n                  used in your home oven. The oven should always be pre-heated\r\n                  to between 375° to 425º depending on the recipe. You will\r\n                  always use the oven in baking mode, never on the broiler. The\r\n                  plank should always be placed in the center of the oven on the\r\n                  metal rack. If your plank has a slight crack, it can be placed\r\n                  on a cookie sheet to ensure none of the juices flow onto the\r\n                  oven's surface. It is best to use a conventional oven. A\r\n                  convection oven can be used, but the whirling hot air can lead\r\n                  to a splitting or cracking of the plank.\r\n                </p>\r\n                <p>\r\n                  After use, baking planks should be washed with warm water and\r\n                  dish soap. I like to use the orange and yellow Tuffy™ pad to\r\n                  remove any baked on juices or seasoning. Rinse with hot water\r\n                  and let the plank air dry. Place in a dry cupboard until next\r\n                  use.\r\n                </p>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div className=\"paperfooter\" style={{ height: \"30px\" }}>\r\n            <div style={{ color: \"transparent\" }}>.</div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </section>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </main>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport default AboutPage;\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
